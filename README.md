# Grocery Store Management System

This is a simple Python project that simulates how a small grocery store might handle its daily tasks.  
It lets you keep track of items in stock, update prices or quantities, and even handle basic billing when a customer makes a purchase.  

I built it using only the Python standard library (no external packages), so it’s lightweight and easy to run anywhere.

## What you can do with it
- View the current inventory
- Add new items or update existing ones
- Search for products by name
- Handle customer purchases and calculate a bill
- Save and load data to a file so it doesn’t reset every time you run the program

That's it no extra setup needed.

Why this project

I wanted to practice problem solving with Python using just the basics — no frameworks, no fancy libraries.
It’s also a good beginner-friendly project for anyone learning how to work with files, functions, and dictionaries in Python.
